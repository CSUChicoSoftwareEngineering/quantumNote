File Structure
==============
Android projects are the projects that eventually get built into an .apk file that you install onto a device. They contain things such as application source code and resource files. Some are generated for you by default, while others should be created if required. The following directories and files comprise an Android project:

[src/](https://github.com/CSUChicoSoftwareEngineering/quantumNote/tree/master/app/src)
Contains your stub Activity file, which is stored at src/your/package/namespace/ActivityName.java. All other source code files (such as .java or .aidl files) go here as well.
[res/](https://github.com/CSUChicoSoftwareEngineering/quantumNote/tree/master/app/src/main/res)
Contains application resources, such as drawable files, layout files, and string values. See Application Resources for more information.
[drawable/](https://github.com/CSUChicoSoftwareEngineering/quantumNote/tree/master/app/src/main/res/) Drawables located in res folder.
For bitmap files (PNG, JPEG, or GIF), 9-Patch image files, and XML files that describe Drawable shapes or Drawable objects that contain multiple states (normal, pressed, or focused). See the Drawable resource type.
[layout/](https://github.com/CSUChicoSoftwareEngineering/quantumNote/tree/master/app/src/main/res/layout)
XML files that are compiled into screen layouts (or part of a screen). See the Layout resource type.
[menu/](https://github.com/CSUChicoSoftwareEngineering/quantumNote/tree/master/app/src/main/res/menu)
For XML files that define application menus. See the Menus resource type.
[values/](https://github.com/CSUChicoSoftwareEngineering/quantumNote/tree/master/app/src/main/res/values)
For XML files that are compiled into many kinds of resource. Unlike other resources in the res/ directory, resources written to XML files in this folder are not referenced by the file name. Instead, the XML element type controls how the resources is defined within them are placed into the R class.
